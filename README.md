# Demonstration

## Teaching Github and Git commands demonstration via Github Classroom.

This is my first workshop for the students of CS Department at VSU.


For this workshop please read this document: a README file serves as the starting point in any codebase, repo, or project. They are essential for understanding the contents, getting the code to work, and contributing any features or changes you'd like to see.

## Workshop Task
In this workshop you will create your own Pseudo App or Project idea. Be creative in your teams you can create any idea you'd like. 

Take 5 minutes to come up with an 'idea' in your teams. Your project will consist of a repository that contains: a README.md file, and at least 2 source code files. 

You will utilize git commands to collaborate and understand version control in your teams. 

**The commands that you will use are at least:**

git add filename (you can use . in place of filename to add all files to the staging area)<br>
git commit -m "message"<br>
git checkout -b "branchname" (to create a new branch)<br>
git checkout branchname (to switch between branches)<br>
git merge<br>
*refer to your Git Cheat Sheet
